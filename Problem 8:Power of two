As the name suggests we just have to determine if the given number is a power of 2.

So if the number is less than equal to zero we return false.
Otherwise we just keep dividing the number by 2 while it is greater than 1. And if it any point it is not divisible by 2, return false. 
Else return true.

class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if(n<=0) return false;
        boolean f=true;
        while(n>1)
        {
            if(n%2!=0)
            {
                f=false;
                break;
            }
            n/=2;
        }
        return f;
    }
}
